# Define a custom_index method that accepts a string and a search term.
# The method should return the first index position of the 
# search term within the string. If the search term does not exist,
# return nil. Do not use the built-in index method in your solution.
#
# Examples:
# The => indicates the expected return value
# custom_index("I am very handsome", "I")     => 0
# custom_index("I am very handsome", "e")     => 6
# custom_index("I am very handsome", "Z")     => nil
# custom_index("I am very handsome", "am")    => 2
# custom_index("I am very handsome", "ma")    => nil

def custom_index(str, search_term)
  i = 0
  while i <= str.length - search_term.length
    if str[i, search_term.length] == search_term
      return i
    end
    i += 1
  end
